# Hi there 👋  
I'm **Adedoyin Ekong**, a DevOps Engineer passionate about building scalable infrastructure and driving DevOps culture through automation, CI/CD, and cloud-native tools.

🚀 **Recently Completed Projects:**  
- **AWS CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions** – End-to-end deployment of a containerized app using GitHub Actions, ECR, and ECS.  
- **Monitoring Infrastructure with Prometheus & Grafana** – Implemented full-stack observability with custom dashboards and alerting on a Kubernetes cluster.

💡 I thrive at the intersection of Cloud Engineering and Infrastructure as Code. Whether it's provisioning with Terraform or automating pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, I’m all about efficiency, reliability, and continuous improvement.
